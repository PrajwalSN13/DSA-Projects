****Basic Banking System****

This project helps user to create a bank account and apply for a loan.

****Description****

The application prompts the user to create an account if none exists, ensuring there is always at least one account in the system. The user is prompted to enter a name and a password for the account for the account along with an initial deposit amount set by the system. Users can deposit or withdraw money from their account by providing the correct account credentials, with withdrawals subject to a minimum balance requirement to avoid a penalty. Additionally, there is a feature to apply for a loan, which is simulated with a simple confirmation message in this implementation.
